      Hi, I’m Tom
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      I am a Full-Stack Software Developer based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I specialize in building scalable, user-friendly web applications using tools like AWS, React, Node.js, and Java.
      <br>
      I come from a background in emergency medical services, which taught me the value of calm problem-solving, clear communication, and staying focused under pressure. Today, I bring those same qualities to the tech world, where I love turning complex ideas into clean, intuitive solutions.
      <br>
      Whether I’m collaborating on a secure backend integration or designing a
      responsive frontend, I’m all about building with purpose and keeping the
      end user in mind. When I’m not working, you'll probably find me working out, spending time
      with my dog, and diving into a new creative project.
      <br><br>
      Let’s connect and build something meaningful!
